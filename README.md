# NuralNet-from-scratch
This is a project in which I create one hidden layered nural network from scratch using numpy and matplotlib.<br/>

<br/><br/>As shown in the image there are 'm' nodes in input, 'n' nodes in the hidden layer and an output node.
<br/>The reason to use a neural network is when the data needs a non linear function to fit, so the most primary example we can use is Logic Gates (It is the Hello World for neural nets).
