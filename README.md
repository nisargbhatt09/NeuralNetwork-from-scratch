# NuralNet-from-scratch
This is a project in which I create one hidden layered nural network from scratch using numpy and matplotlib.<br/>
<br/>![image](one_layered_network.jpeg)
<br/><br/>As shown in the image there are 'm' nodes in input, 'n' nodes in the hidden layer and an output node.
<br/>The reason to use a neural network is when the data needs a non linear function to fit, so the most primary example we can use is Logic Gates (It is the Hello World for neural nets).
<br/>So for example I am taking XOR Gate as training data. You can feed your own data to this network.

<br/><br/> Now for this example we have 2 inputs so we will set input_nodes = 2, hidden_nodes = 3(can be any number for you), output_nodes = 1(because the value can be either 0 or 1)
